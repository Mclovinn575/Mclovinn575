- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mclovinn575

- 👀 I’m interested in creating games and learning how to create applications with the .NET framework.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# along with the .NET framework. Once I get a good grasp on C#, I would like to move onto Python and expand from there.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. I'm taking whatever I can to increase my own knowledge base. Even if it's not to work directly but rather to observe, that's fine too.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me by email at Michael.t.love3@gmail.com
