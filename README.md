- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mclovinn575

- 👀 Currently looking into Database systems, Machine Learning, Task Automation and Software Development.

- 🌱 Expanding my knowledge of numerous coding languages including Python, Java, PowerShell, C#, and more.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. I'm taking whatever I can to increase my own knowledge base. Even if it's not to work directly but rather to observe, that's fine too.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me by email at Michael.t.love3@gmail.com
